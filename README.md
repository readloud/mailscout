# MailScout - A Python Business Email Finder and Email Validator

MailScout is a Python library designed for finding business email addresses and simple email validation.

It offers a range of tools for email validation, SMTP checks, and generating potential business email addresses based on provided names and common naming conventions.

## Features

- Generate and find potential business email addresses based on provided names and common patterns.
- Check SMTP deliverability of email addresses.
- Detect catch-all domains.
- Normalize names to create email-friendly formats.
- Bulk email finder for multiple domains.

## Installation

Install MailScout using pip:

```bash
pip install mailscout
```

## Initialization

### Initialize the Scout class

```python
from mailscout import Scout
scout = Scout()
```

The **`Scout`** class is the core of the MailScout library, providing various functionalities for email finding, processing and validation. When initializing a **`Scout`** object, you can customize its behavior using several arguments:

### Arguments

- **`check_variants (bool)`**: If set to **`True`**, the Scout object will generate and check different variants of email addresses based on provided names. Defaults to **`True`**.
- `**check_prefixes (bool)**`: Enables the checking of common email prefixes (like 'info', 'contact', etc.) when generating email addresses. This is useful for finding potential business emails. Defaults to `**True**`.
- **`check_catchall (bool)`**: Determines whether the Scout object should check if a domain is a catch-all. A catch-all domain accepts emails sent to any address under that domain. Defaults to **`True`**.
- **`normalize (bool)`**: If set to **`True`**, the Scout object will normalize names to create email-friendly formats. This is particularly useful for names with diacritics or special characters. Defaults to **`True`**.
- **`num_threads (int)`**: Specifies the number of threads to use for concurrent email checking. Increasing the number of threads can speed up the process when checking a large number of emails. Defaults to **`5`**.
- **`num_bulk_threads (int)`**: Sets the number of threads for bulk email finding tasks. This is separate from **`num_threads`** to provide flexibility in handling large-scale operations. Defaults to **`1`**.
- **`smtp_timeout (int)`**: The timeout in seconds for the SMTP connection. This parameter is crucial to avoid long waits on unresponsive servers. Defaults to **`2`**.

## Usage

### Find Business Emails with Names

Mailscout generates combinations using the names you provide. These names should ideally belong to the same person, typically a first name and a last name.

To find business emails, we use the `**find_valid_emails**` method.

Names might be a list of strings.

```python
names = ["Batuhan", "Akyazı"]
# or, names = ["Batuhan Akyazı"]
domain = "example.com"

emails = scout.find_valid_emails(domain, names)

print(emails)
# ['b.akyazi@example.com']
```

You can also provide a list of lists containing strings to check on multiple people.

```python
names = [["Jeff", "Winger"], ["Ben Cheng"], ["Łukas Nowicki"]]
domain = "microsoft.com"

emails = scout.find_valid_emails(domain, names)

print(emails)
# ['jeff@microsoft.com', 'ben.cheng@microsoft.com', 'bencheng@microsoft.com', 'ben@microsoft.com', 'lukas@microsoft.com']
```

Or simply a string.

```python
names = "Jeffrey Tobias Winger"
domain = "microsoft.com"

emails = scout.find_valid_emails(domain, names)

print(emails)
# ['winger.tobias@microsoft.com']
```

### Find Business Emails with Common Prefixes

If you don't provide any names, Mailscout will use brute force on common prefixes to find email addresses.

```python
domain = "microsoft.com"
emails = scout.find_valid_emails(domain)

print(emails)
# ['support@microsoft.com', 'team@microsoft.com', 'marketing@microsoft.com', 'accounts@microsoft.com', 'help@microsoft.com', 'finance@microsoft.com', 'manager@microsoft.com', 'events@microsoft.com', 'community@microsoft.com', 'feedback@microsoft.com', 'dev@microsoft.com', 'developer@microsoft.com', 'status@microsoft.com', 'security@microsoft.com']
```

### Find Business Emails in Bulk

To find valid email addresses in bulk for multiple domains and names, use the `**find_valid_emails_bulk**` method. This function takes a list of dictionaries, each containing a domain and optional names to check, and returns a list of dictionaries, each containing the domain, names, and a list of valid emails found.

You may think of each list item as a task and provide the data accordingly.

Here is an example of how to use this function:

```python
email_data = [
    {"domain": "example.com", "names": ["John Doe"]},
    {"domain": "example.com", "names": ["Jane Smith"]},
		{"domain": "example.com"}
]

valid_emails = scout.find_valid_emails_bulk(email_data)

print(valid_emails)
# [{'domain': 'example.com', 'names': ['John Doe'], 'valid_emails': ['j.doe@example.com']}, {'domain': 'example2.com', 'names': ['Jane Smith'], 'valid_emails': ['j.smith@example2.com', 'jane.smith@example2.com']}, {'domain': 'example.com', 'valid_emails': ['info@example.com']}]

```

## Utility Methods

Mailscout comes with a variety of utility methods for different tasks.

### Check SMTP Deliverability (Email Validation)

To validate an email with Mailscout, use the `**check_smtp**` method.

```python
email = "batuhan@microsoft.com"
is_deliverable = scout.check_smtp(email)

print(f"Email {email} is deliverable: {is_deliverable}")
# Email batuhan@microsoft.com is deliverable: False
```

### Checking for Catch-All Domains

The **`check_email_catchall`** method can be used to determine if a given domain is configured as a catch-all. A catch-all domain is set up to accept emails sent to any address under that domain, even if the specific address does not exist.

```python
domain = "example.com"
is_catchall = scout.check_email_catchall(domain)

print(f"Domain {email} is catch-all: {is_catchall}")
# Email xample.com is catch-all: True
```

### Normalize Names into Email-friendly Format

To normalize a name for an email-friendly format, use the `**normalize_name**` method. This method converts a non-compliant name into a format that is acceptable for an email address. Here are some examples:

```python
name1 = "Şule"
name2 = "Dzirżyterg"

normalized_name1 = scout.normalize_name(name1)
normalized_name2 = scout.normalize_name(name2)

print(normalized_name1)
# 'sule'
print(normalized_name2)
# 'dzirzyterg'

```
